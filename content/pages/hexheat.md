Heatmaps|
Heatmaps pack a lot of information into a dense format. Heatmaps can be thought of as a three dimensional column chart: instead of viewing how numeric data changes based on one categorical column, heatmaps show how numeric data changes based on two categorical columns. Heatmaps display one categorical column on the x axis, another categorical column on the y axis, and a numeric column as a color.|

\Hexbin plot|
Hexbin plots are exactly like heatmaps, but instead of using categorical columns for the x and y axes hexbin plots use numeric columns. As the name suggests, hexbin plots use hexes instead of squares (as in heatmaps).|
