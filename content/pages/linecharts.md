Single line charts|
Single line charts demonstrate the relationship between two columns in your data. The chart shows how the column along the y axis changes according to the column along the x axis; the y axis should be a numeric column, like price, and the x axis should be a numeric or ordered categorical (ordinal) column, like tuition or months of the year.|

\Multi-line charts|
Multi-line charts perform the same function as single line charts, but allow for comparison across an additional categorical column. Multi-line charts allow for comparison of 3 columns - one is displayed along the x axis, one is displayed along the y axis, and one is used to choose the color of the line. These charts are useful for comparing how one categorical column effects trends in your data.|
