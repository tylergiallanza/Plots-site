Column charts|
Column charts allow for comparison of numeric values across categories. Column charts work best for a small number of categories - otherwise, the labels for the categories makes the chart difficult to read.|

\Bar charts|
Bar charts are exactly the same as column charts, simply rotated 90 degrees. Bar charts have the advantage of allowing for a slightly larger numeber of categories than column charts. Additionally, categories with long text labels often fit better onto a bar chart than onto a column chart.|

\Stacked column charts|
Stacked column charts show the composition of the dataset by splitting each column in a column chart by an additional categorical variable. The column cannot be split into very many categories, or else the visual gets messy.|

\Stacked bar charts|
Stacked bar charts are exactly the same as stacked column charts, simply rotated 90 degrees. As with bar charts, stacked bar charts allow for a greater number of categories and longer text labels than stacked column charts.|
